Game Review of the stealth-based game The Raven

[Play The Raven here](https://armorgames.com/play/10003/the-raven?tag-referral=stealth)

## Summary
 The Raven is a 2D stealth-platformer developed by XDGames. You play as The Raven and must sneak past sentry robots in order to uncover the truth behind a lab experiment gone wrong. You use the arrow keys to move around the level. You can also double jump which makes platforming easier. To sneak past sentry bots you have to stand still in the shadows and move when the time is right. You can collect  Journal and Video logs to find out the story behind the experiment. You can also collect Memory Chips.

## Final Thoughts
  I had some problems with the game overall. 
 
 For one thing, the UI was way too big. It covered most of the screen. The player icon, life count, and chip count took up a big part of the screen. The level has floating text which is meant to help the player. However, the text remains for the Journal and Video logs, leaving the text floating and pointing at nothing.

 The developers forgot to put a deathzone at the bottom of stages, so if you miss a jump you will be falling forever. There is also no pause screen, so when you do get caught in the endless void, you have to refresh the game's page and start the game over from the very beginning.
 
 I also have a few minor complaints. There are cutscenes inbetween levels, but only the very first cutscene can be skipped. I would rather have none of the cutscenes be skippable instead of just one, that way the game is more uniform. From what I can tell, the Memory Chips server no purpose. There is no shop you can use the chips in to upgrade the player. You don't get an extra life when you collect a certain number of chips.
